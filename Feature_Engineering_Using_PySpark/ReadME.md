This hands-on exercise dives into **feature engineering with PySpark**, focusing on **structuring and transforming raw data for machine learning at scale**. Using the California Housing Dataset, it walks through real-world techniques like **Polynomial Expansion** to capture non-linear relationships, **Bucketizer** for binning continuous variables, and a comparison of **Normalizer vs. StandardScaler** to understand their impact on model performance. To efficiently **manage high-dimensional data**, it incorporates **VectorAssembler and VectorIndexer**, ensuring a well-structured feature set for downstream modeling. Built on **Apache Sparkâ€™s distributed framework**, the exercise highlights how to apply these techniques effectively in **large-scale environments, balancing performance, interpretability, and scalability.**
